# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: 
The main objective of this project is to create a captivating webpage showcasing my passion for bakery.
Here are the functionalities that have been implemented: 
- Navigation Bar: I have designed a navigation bar that allows users to easily access the About, Contact, and Home pages.

- Footer: A footer has been incorporated into the webpage, featuring icons that redirect users to social media pages such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Additionally, it includes links to important policies such as Privacy Policy, GDPR Policy, and Cookie Policy.

- Image Slider: Users can explore various dessert categories by accessing them. They can view multiple pictures within each category by scrolling through the ImgSlider or using the left-right arrows. Clicking on a different picture will set it as the main image.

- Contact Page: On the dedicated contact page, I have added a map component displaying the provided address. Furthermore, a fully functional contact form has been implemented using EmailJS, along with the necessary ENV file extension.

- JSON Database: To dynamically manage content, I employed a JSON database. It stores arrays of objects containing information such as path, title, description, id, photos, individualTitle, and individualDescription. As a result, the webpage's URL and content adapt based on the accessed category.
